BeeslyString              Problem Description
                          Mr. Jim likes playing with strings a lot, so Mrs. Pam gifted him a string A which has some
                          very unique magical powers. The string consists of lowercase Latin letters 'p','a' and 'm' only.
                          In one wish, Mr Jim can perform one of the following operations:
                          Remove exactly one occurrence of 'p' and exactly one occurrence of 'm', from anywhere inside string A.
                          Remove exactly one occurrence of 'a' and exactly one occurrence of 'm', from anywhere inside string A.
                          Now Mr. Jim wants to know if after some number of wishes is it possible to make string A empty.
                          Return 1 if it is possible to make string A empty after some number of operations otherwise Return 0

Matrix Transpose          Problem Description
                          You are given a matrix A, you have to return another matrix which is the transpose of A.
                          NOTE: Transpose of a matrix A is defined as - AT[i][j] = A[j][i] ;
                          Where 1 ≤ i ≤ col and 1 ≤ j ≤ row.
                          The transpose of a matrix switches the element at (i, j)th index to (j, i)th index and the
                          element at (j, i)th index to (i, j)th index.
                          example
                          int[][] matrix_A = { {1, 2, 3},{4, 5, 6},{7, 8, 9}};
                          output [[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]]
                          int[][] matrix_B = { {1, 2},{1, 2},{1, 2}};
                          output [[1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2]]

ReplacingChar             Problem Description:
                          Write a program to return a string from a given string s where all occurrences of
                          the first char of the string except the first occurrence has been changed to '$'.

RowColumnSums             Problem Description
                          You are given a matrix A, you have to return an array containing the sum of each row's elements
                          followed by the sum of each column element of the matrix.
                          NOTE: If the matrix given is of size (N x M), then the array you return would be of size (N + M), 
                          where the first N elements contain the sum of each N row, and the next M elements contain the sum of
                          each M column.

SumOfTwoMatrix            as the name say calculates the sum of two matrix

Time to end Corona        Problem Description
                          Given three integers, A, B, and C. You have to find the number of days it will take to reach zero cases of Corona in a city.
                          A - Average cases recovered in a day of the corona.
                          B - Number of new cases of corona daily.
                          C - Current active cases of the corona.
                          Return the minimum number of days it will take to reach 0 active cases of Covid.
                          * Input Format
                          The first argument will be integer A, which denotes the recovered cases in a day.
                          The second argument will be integer B, which denotes the new cases in a day.
                          The third argument will be integer C, which denotes the currently active cases.
